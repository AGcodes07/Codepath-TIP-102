"""
Winnie the Pooh and his friends are playing a game called Poohsticks where they drop sticks in a stream and race them. They time how long it takes each player's stick to float under Poohsticks Bridge to score each round.

Write a function count_less_than() to help Pooh and his friends determine how many players should move on to the next round of Poohsticks. count_less_than() should accept a list of integers race_times and an integer threshold and return the number of race times less than threshold.


Example Usage

race_times = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
threshold = 4
count_less_than(race_times, threshold)

race_times = []
threshold = 4
count_less_than(race_times, threshold)
Example Output:

3
0

def count_less_than(race_times, threshold):
	passed_times = 0

		if times < threshold:
			passed_times += 1
	return passed_times
	

race_times = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
