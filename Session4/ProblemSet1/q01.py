"""You're curating a large collection of NFTs for a digital art gallery, and your first task is to extract the names of these NFTs from a given list of dictionaries. Each dictionary in the list represents an NFT, and contains information such as the name, creator, and current value.

Write the extract_nft_names() function, which takes in this list and returns a list of all NFT names.

Evaluate the time and space complexity of your solution. Define your variables and provide a rationale for why you believe your solution has the stated time and space complexity.

Example Usage:

def extract_nft_names(nft_collection):
    pass

# Example usage:
nft_collection = [
    {"name": "Abstract Horizon", "creator": "ArtByAlex", "value": 5.4},
    {"name": "Pixel Dreams", "creator": "DreamyPixel", "value": 7.2},
    {"name": "Future City", "creator": "UrbanArt", "value": 3.8}
]

nft_collection_2 = [
    {"name": "Crypto Kitty", "creator": "CryptoPets", "value": 10.5},
    {"name": "Galactic Voyage", "creator": "SpaceArt", "value": 6.7}
]

nft_collection_3 = [
    {"name": "Golden Hour", "creator": "SunsetArtist", "value": 8.9}
]



print(extract_nft_names(nft_collection_2))
print(extract_nft_names(nft_collection_3))
Example Output:

['Abstract Horizon', 'Pixel Dreams', 'Future City']
['Crypto Kitty', 'Galactic Voyage']
['Golden Hour']
